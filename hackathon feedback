I want to provide you with feedback on your hackathon project.
You successfully implemented several key features, including user registration and login functionality with password prompts for incorrect entries,
user data storage in a database, money management between accounts, and integration with an external API for currency conversion. Additionally,
it's commendable that you utilized a setup.sql file, organized your code with routers, models, and controllers, and presented an acceptable user interface.
While your project demonstrates a solid foundation, there's room for improvement.
I would suggest focusing on enhancing the user interface and adding additional features to make it more comprehensive. Keep up the good work!
